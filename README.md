#### Installing Subtitle Edit on macOS (Unsigned App)

Because *Subtitle Edit* is not signed with an Apple developer certificate, macOS will block it by default. You can still install and run it by following these steps:

1. **Download** and **double-click** the `.dmg` file to mount it.
2. In the window that appears, **drag `Subtitle Edit.app` into your `Applications` folder**.
3. Open the **Terminal** app (you can find it via Spotlight or in `/Applications/Utilities/`).
4. In Terminal, run the following commands to remove macOS’s security quarantine flag and add adhoc code signature:
   ````bash
   sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Subtitle Edit.app"
   ````

   ````bash
   sudo codesign --force --deep --sign - "/Applications/Subtitle Edit.app"
   ````

### Linux
- Requires **libmpv** (install via package manager, e.g. `sudo apt install mpv libmpv-dev`)
- Requires **ffmpeg** (e.g. `sudo apt install ffmpeg`)

> ⚙️ Note: The provided builds are self-contained and do not require a separate .NET installation.
